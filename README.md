# Use-of-Topical-Acetone-To-Remove-Bone-Cancer
100% Acetone from Walgreens was successfully used to remove dental plaque. The cleaning was then treated with Calcium. The plaque turns into gelatinous white "meltdown" salts on contact with acetone. The acetone was applied with a dental pick which was dipped into acetone before each scaping.

Mouth rinsing and tooth brushing removed the white meltdown. Acetone on the toothbrush with toothpaste was highly effective.
