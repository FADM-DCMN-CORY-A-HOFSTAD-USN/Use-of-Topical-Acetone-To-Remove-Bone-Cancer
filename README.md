# Use-of-Topical-Acetone-To-Remove-Bone-Cancer
100% Acetone from Walgreens was successfully used to remove dental plaque. The cleaning was then treated with Calcium. The plaque turns into gelatinous white "meltdown" salts on contact with acetone. The acetone was applied with a dental pick which was dipped into acetone before each scaping.

Mouth rinsing and tooth brushing removed the white meltdown. Acetone on the toothbrush with toothpaste was highly effective.

### 1\. Objective

This guide outlines an in-clinic procedure for removing hardened black tartar using a combination of chemical dissolution and mechanical debridement, as an alternative to drilling.

### 2\. General Safety & Preparation

-   **Warning:** The primary chemical agent, 100% pure pharmaceutical-grade acetone, is a known skin irritant.

-   **Clinician & Patient PPE:** Appropriate PPE must be used for both medical staff and the patient to ensure acetone does not come in contact with the eyes.

-   **Patient Communication:** Ensure the patient does not swallow any of the chemical agents. Because this procedure does not involve drilling, the patient can communicate discomfort at any time. Clinicians should check in with the patient regularly.

### 3\. Tartar Removal Procedure

This procedure involves aggressive scraping and brushing. Precision is essential to avoid patient discomfort and tissue damage.

1.  **Agent Application:** Dip a precision dental pick into the 100% acetone.

2.  **Tartar Debridement:** Apply the acetone-wetted pick directly to the black tartar, including under the gum line. The tartar will degrade into a white, gelatinous residue.

3.  **Residue Removal:** Use an extra-hard charcoal toothbrush with fluoride-free toothpaste to brush away the white residue.

4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-3 as needed.

### 4\. Critical Technique & Warnings

-   **Preventing Gum Irritation:** The primary goal is to avoid causing "red, swollen, or bleeding gums."

-   **Use the Right Tool:** The extra-hard toothbrush is large and aggressive. **Do not use the brush to attack the black tartar itself.**

    -   **Use the dental pick** for precision work to break down tartar.

    -   **Use the toothbrush** only to clean out the loose white residue.

-   **Patient Comfort:** If the patient reports discomfort or if a slip occurs, provide the patient with a short break to calm down.

-   **Bleeding Protocol:** If bleeding is severe, immediately rinse the patient's mouth with hydrogen peroxide and follow the clinic's standard protocols for bleeding.

### 5\. Post-Debridement Rinsing

1.  **Debriding Agent:** After all tartar and residue are removed, rinse the mouth thoroughly with hydrogen peroxide ("oral debriding agent").

2.  **Oil Pull:** Following the peroxide rinse, perform a final oil-pulling rinse (e.g., with coconut oil) to soothe the tissues.
